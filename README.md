# MagicWave ðŸŽµ - Frequency Therapy App

**MagicWave** is a modern React Native frequency therapy application built with Expo that generates real-time sine wave audio for healing, meditation, and relaxation. Experience the power of binaural beats, solfeggio frequencies, and sacred sound therapy with a beautiful, intuitive interface.

## Features

### ðŸŽ§ Real Audio Generation
The app generates authentic sine wave frequencies using mathematical algorithms rather than pre-recorded audio files. This ensures pure, precise frequencies for optimal therapeutic effects.

### ðŸŒ™ Sleep Timer
Set automatic sleep timers (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 minutes) to automatically stop playback when you fall asleep. Perfect for bedtime meditation sessions.

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern Design
Beautiful, minimalistic interface with smooth 60fps animations and both light and dark themes. The design prioritizes clarity and ease of use while maintaining visual appeal.

### ðŸ“± Frequency Categories
* **Meditation & Relaxation**: Traditional meditation frequencies including 432Hz, 528Hz, and other healing tones
* **Hindu Gods & Mantras**: Sacred frequencies associated with Krishna, Shiva, Hanuman, and other deities
* **Binaural Beats**: Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta wave frequencies for different mental states
* **Sacred Tasks**: Specific frequencies for focused work and concentration
* **Solfeggio Frequencies**: Ancient musical scale used for healing and spiritual development

### ðŸ’¾ Favorites & Recent
Save your favorite frequencies and access recently played sounds. The app tracks your listening history and provides quick access to preferred frequencies.

### ðŸ”Š Audio Controls
Full volume control, play/pause functionality, and seamless audio management. Only one frequency plays at a time to maintain audio clarity.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
MagicWave follows a modern React Native architecture with proper separation of concerns:

**Context Pattern**: The AudioContext manages global audio state across the entire application, providing a clean interface for audio operations.

**Component Structure**: Reusable components like FrequencyCard, SpotifyPlaybackBar, and Animated components ensure consistent behavior throughout the app.

**Utility Classes**: Dedicated utility classes handle audio generation, storage operations, and theme management.

### Audio Engine Deep Dive

The heart of MagicWave is its custom audio engine that generates frequencies in real-time:

```javascript
class FrequencyAudioEngine {
  generateSineWave(frequency, duration = 10, sampleRate = 44100) {
    const samples = duration * sampleRate;
    const amplitude = 0.3;
    const audioData = new Float32Array(samples);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < samples; i++) {
      const t = i / sampleRate;
      audioData[i] = amplitude * Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * frequency * t);
    }
    
    return audioData;
  }
}
```

**Sine Wave Generation**: The app calculates each audio sample using the mathematical sine function. For a given frequency, it generates a pure tone without harmonics or distortion.

**WAV File Creation**: Generated audio data is converted into WAV format using proper header structures and 16-bit PCM encoding. This ensures compatibility across all devices.

**Base64 Encoding**: The WAV data is encoded as a base64 data URI, allowing expo-av to play the generated audio seamlessly.

### Real-time Audio Processing

**Sample Rate**: Uses standard 44.1kHz sample rate for CD-quality audio output.

**Amplitude Control**: Maintains comfortable 0.3 amplitude to prevent audio distortion while ensuring audible output.

**Looping**: Implements seamless looping using expo-av's built-in looping capabilities, creating continuous frequency playback.

### State Management

The AudioContext provides centralized state management for:

```javascript
const AudioProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [currentFrequency, setCurrentFrequency] = useState(null);
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const [volume, setVolume] = useState(0.5);
  const [timer, setTimer] = useState(null);
  // ... additional state
};
```

**Frequency State**: Tracks currently playing frequency and playback status across all screens.

**Volume Management**: Maintains volume levels with real-time updates to the audio engine.

**Timer Integration**: Handles sleep timer functionality with automatic cleanup when timers expire.

### Sleep Timer Implementation

The sleep timer uses JavaScript's setTimeout with proper cleanup:

```javascript
async setTimer(minutes) {
  if (this.timer) {
    clearTimeout(this.timer);
    this.timer = null;
  }
  
  if (minutes > 0) {
    this.timer = setTimeout(() => {
      this.stopFrequency();
    }, minutes * 60 * 1000);
  }
}
```

**Automatic Cleanup**: Clears existing timers before setting new ones to prevent multiple timers running simultaneously.

**Memory Management**: Properly nullifies timer references to prevent memory leaks.

### Animation System

MagicWave uses React Native Reanimated 3 for smooth 60fps animations:

**Native Driver**: All animations use the native driver to ensure smooth performance by running on the UI thread.

**Optimized Easing**: Custom easing functions provide natural motion that feels responsive and polished.

**Gesture Handling**: Implements smooth gesture recognition for swipe navigation and interactive elements.

### Theme System

The theme system supports both manual and automatic theme switching:

```javascript
const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [themeMode, setThemeMode] = useState('system');
  const [manualTheme, setManualTheme] = useState('light');
  
  const systemColorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const currentTheme = themeMode === 'system' ? systemColorScheme : manualTheme;
};
```

**System Integration**: Automatically detects system theme preferences and responds to changes.

**Persistent Storage**: Saves user theme preferences using AsyncStorage for consistency across app launches.

**Dynamic Colors**: Uses Material Design 3 color tokens for consistent theming throughout the interface.

### Storage Management

**AsyncStorage**: Utilizes React Native's AsyncStorage for persisting favorites, recent frequencies, and user preferences.

**Data Serialization**: Properly serializes complex objects like frequency data and user statistics for storage.

**Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling for storage operations to prevent data corruption.

### Performance Optimizations

**Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed to reduce initial bundle size and improve startup time.

**Memory Management**: Properly disposes of audio resources when components unmount to prevent memory leaks.

**Native Animations**: Uses native animation drivers to ensure smooth performance even on lower-end devices.

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Frequencies

To add new frequencies to MagicWave, edit the `src/data/frequencies.js` file:

```javascript
export const customFrequencies = [
  {
    id: 'custom_001',
    name: 'Your Custom Frequency',
    frequency: 333,
    description: 'Description of the frequency effects',
    category: 'Custom',
    image: 'ðŸŽµ',
    benefits: ['Benefit 1', 'Benefit 2'],
    chakra: 'Heart',
    color: '#4CAF50'
  }
];
```

**Required Fields**: Each frequency needs an id, name, frequency value (in Hz), category, and image emoji.

**Optional Fields**: Description, benefits array, chakra association, and custom color can enhance the user experience.

### Modifying Categories

Categories are defined in the same frequencies.js file and can be customized:

```javascript
export const frequencyCategories = [
  {
    name: 'Your Category',
    icon: 'ðŸŽ¯',
    color: '#FF5722',
    description: 'Category description'
  }
];
```

### Theme Customization

Modify `src/utils/theme.js` to change colors and styling:

```javascript
export const lightTheme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#your-primary-color',
    surface: '#your-surface-color',
    // ... other color definitions
  }
};
```

**Color System**: Uses Material Design 3 color tokens for consistency and accessibility.

**Dynamic Theming**: Colors automatically adapt between light and dark modes.

### Audio Engine Modifications

For advanced users, the audio engine can be modified in `src/utils/audio.js`:

**Sample Rate**: Change the sample rate for different audio quality (higher = better quality, larger files).

**Amplitude**: Adjust the amplitude for different volume characteristics.

**Wave Generation**: Implement different wave types (square, sawtooth, triangle) by modifying the generation function.
